## üéÆ Detailed Game Logic & Requirements

### Game Structure
- **Session Length**: Each session = 15 words
- **Total Levels**: 3 levels (Easy ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Hard)
- **Total Words**: 45 words maximum (15 per level)
- **Lives System**: 3 hearts per session

### Word Selection Logic
- **Data Source**: Google Sheets CSV with columns:
  - **Column A**: Context/Passage (displayed to player)
  - **Column B**: Correct answer
  - **Column C**: Incorrect answer
  - **Column D**: Difficulty level (1=Easy, 2=Medium, 3=Hard)
- **Filtering**: Words filtered by Column D values based on current level
- **Randomization**: Words shuffled within each difficulty level
- **Re-shuffling**: Fresh random order on every replay

### Level Progression System
- **Level 0 (Easy)**: 
  - Words: Column D = 1
  - Progress Display: "‡∫ï‡∫≠‡∫ö‡∫ñ‡∫∑‡∫Å: X / 15"
  - Threshold: 15 words to complete
- **Level 1 (Medium)**:
  - Words: Column D = 2
  - Progress Display: "‡∫ï‡∫≠‡∫ö‡∫ñ‡∫∑‡∫Å: X / 30"
  - Threshold: 15 words to complete (30 total)
- **Level 2 (Hard)**:
  - Words: Column D = 3
  - Progress Display: "‡∫ï‡∫≠‡∫ö‡∫ñ‡∫∑‡∫Å: X / 45"
  - Threshold: 15 words to complete (45 total)

### Scoring & Lives System
- **Correct Answer**: +1 to current streak, +1 to level progress
- **Incorrect Answer**: -1 life, streak resets to 0
- **Life Recovery**: +1 life bonus when completing a session (capped at 3)
- **Game Over**: When lives reach 0
- **Level Complete**: When 15 words completed in current level

### Replay & Reset Logic
- **Replay Current Level**:
  - Score resets to 0
  - Lives reset to 3
  - Level progress resets to 0
  - Words re-shuffled for fresh order
  - Total progress tracking continues
- **Complete Game Reset**:
  - All scores reset to 0
  - Lives reset to 3
  - All progress reset to 0
  - All words re-shuffled
  - Returns to Level 0 (Easy)

### Progress Tracking
- **Current Streak**: Consecutive correct answers in current session
- **Best Streak**: Highest streak achieved (persistent)
- **Level Progress**: Words completed in current level (0-15)
- **Total Words Completed**: Cumulative words across all sessions
- **Level Completion**: Tracks which levels have been completed

### Answer Validation Logic
- **Word Pair Storage**: Current word pair stored globally for accurate checking
- **Answer Checking**: Compares selected word with Column B (correct answer)
- **Visual Feedback**: Green for correct, red for incorrect
- **Sound Feedback**: Different sounds for correct/incorrect answers

### UI Elements & Display
- **Progress Counter**: Shows current/total words for level
- **Total Progress**: Displays cumulative words completed
