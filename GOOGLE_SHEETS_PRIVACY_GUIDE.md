# 🔒 Google Sheets Privacy Guide

## Current Status
Your Google Sheets is currently **PUBLIC** and accessible via the export URL.

## How to Make Your Google Sheets Private

### Step 1: Change Sharing Settings
1. **Open your Google Sheet**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jhdIOg9aqy7Jb28pqnz9I5F23uQ8HYyABvvMxqSzGr0/
2. **Click "Share"** (top-right corner)
3. **Change from "Anyone with the link can view"** to:
   - **"Restricted"** (only people you invite)
   - OR **"Anyone with the link can view"** but keep it unlisted

### Step 2: Update Your Game Code
Since your sheet will be private, you need to use a different approach:

#### Option A: Use Google Apps Script (Recommended)
1. **Create a Google Apps Script**:
   - Go to https://script.google.com/
   - Create new project
   - Add this code:

```javascript
function doGet() {
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById('1jhdIOg9aqy7Jb28pqnz9I5F23uQ8HYyABvvMxqSzGr0').getActiveSheet();
  const data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  
  // Convert to CSV format
  const csv = data.map(row => row.join(',')).join('\n');
  
  return ContentService
    .createTextOutput(csv)
    .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.CSV);
}
```

2. **Deploy as Web App**:
   - Click "Deploy" → "New deployment"
   - Type: "Web app"
   - Execute as: "Me"
   - Who has access: "Anyone"
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Copy the web app URL

3. **Update your game**:
   - Replace `GAME_DATA_URL` with the new Apps Script URL

#### Option B: Use Firebase Firestore (Most Secure)
1. **Export your sheet data to Firestore**
2. **Create a Firestore collection** called "gameWords"
3. **Update your game** to fetch from Firestore instead

#### Option C: Keep Public but Unlisted
1. **Keep sharing as "Anyone with the link can view"**
2. **Don't share the link publicly**
3. **Only you know the URL**

## Recommended Approach: Option A (Google Apps Script)
