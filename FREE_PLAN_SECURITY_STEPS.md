# 🆓 Firebase Free Plan Security Steps

## What You CAN Do (Free):

### 1️⃣ **Firestore Security Rules** ✅
- Go to: Firestore Database → Rules
- Copy and paste the rules from `FIREBASE_SECURITY_RULES_ESSENTIAL.txt`
- Click "Publish"
- **This is your main protection!**

### 2️⃣ **Authentication Settings** ✅
- Go to: Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
- Keep only:
  - `oudomsavanh.github.io`
  - `localhost`
  - Firebase's default domains
- Remove any suspicious domains

### 3️⃣ **Remove Config from GitHub** ✅
```bash
./remove-firebase-config.sh
git push origin main
```

### 4️⃣ **Monitor Usage** ✅
- Check Firebase Console daily
- Look for unusual spikes in:
  - Authentication attempts
  - Database reads/writes
  - Any errors

## What Requires Billing (Skip for now):
- ❌ Firebase Storage
- ❌ App Check (needs reCAPTCHA billing)
- ❌ Cloud Functions
- ❌ Advanced monitoring

## 🛡️ Your Security Status:

With just Firestore Rules + Authorized Domains, you're protected against:
- ✅ Unauthorized database access
- ✅ Data manipulation
- ✅ API abuse from unknown domains
- ✅ Most common attacks

## 📱 Quick Test:

After applying rules, test your security:
1. Open your game in an incognito window
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Try to access Firestore without logging in
4. It should fail with "Missing or insufficient permissions"

## 💡 Free Plan Limits (FYI):
- Firestore: 50K reads, 20K writes per day
- Authentication: 10K verifications per month
- Hosting: 10GB bandwidth per month

These are usually enough for small-medium projects!

**Remember**: Even without billing, Firestore Rules + Domain restrictions provide good security for a closed-source project!
